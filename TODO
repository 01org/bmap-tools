1. Make bmaptool fail if --bmap option was not specified, and allow bmap-less
   copying only if --nobmap option is specified.
2. Try to automatically find for the bmap file in the same directory where the
   image is stored.
3. Support URL paths to the image and bmap.
4. Add a real man page to the project.
5. In block device optimizations - print a warning when something cannot be
   done. Currently we ignore any kind of error and do not print anything. It is
   better to know if something is not exactly as expected.
6. When file size is unknown, implement a "wheel" instead of progress bar
