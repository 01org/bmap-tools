1. bmaptool create is slow and can be improved if we use the FIEMAP ioctl
   better. Currently we are calling it for each block.
2. When bmaptool is killed or Ctrl-C'ed half-way through, it should delete
   the files it creates.
3. Instead of using extention to identify compression type - use the magic
   signatures as documented here:
