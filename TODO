Current TODO list, any help with these is appreciated.

2. Implement GPG signatures support, just like this is done in Fedora
   https://fedoraproject.org/static/checksums/Fedora-19-i386-CHECKSUM
3. In setup.py, fetch the version from 'bmaptool' file.
4. Teach the 'make_a_release.sh' script to update the version and the
   changelog.
5. Fsync before creating the bmap file (probably use FIEMAP_FLAG_SYNC flag)
6. Write in the man page, docs, and may be --help that it is very important
   that the image is not changed while we create the bmep file, and after we
   have created it too.
7. Verify that unmapped areas have all zeroes to guarantee integrity.
8. Update the man pages
9. Teach bmaptool to update the alternate GPT partition
