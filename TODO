Current TODO list, any help with these is appreciated.

1. Switch from SHA1 to SHA256
2. Implement GPG signatures support, just like this is done in Fedora
   https://fedoraproject.org/static/checksums/Fedora-19-i386-CHECKSUM
3. In setup.py, fetch the version from 'bmaptool' file.
4. Teach the 'make_a_release.sh' script to update the version and the
   changelog.
