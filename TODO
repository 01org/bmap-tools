1. bmaptool create is slow and can be improved if we use the FIEMAP ioctl
   better. Currently we are calling it for each block.
2. In the block device optimization code - remember the original settings and
   reconstruct them after writing.
3. In 'bmaptool create' when the blocks rage consists of a single block (say
   18282), write it in form of <>18282</> instead of less readable
   <>18282-18282</> form. 'bmaptool copy' supports both already.
4. Try to read and write in parrallell from different threads - this may improve
   USB stick flashing speed.
5. The block device optimizations will not work if it was /dev/sdc1 instead of
   /dev/sdc - fix this.
